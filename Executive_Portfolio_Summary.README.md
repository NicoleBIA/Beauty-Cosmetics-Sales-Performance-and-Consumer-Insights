## ðŸŸ¦ Executive Dashboard Summary

###  Sales Performance & Revenue Highlights
- Total revenue for January 2025: **$2,584.88**  
- **Highest revenue day:** January 3rd ($349.93)  
- **West Region** led in revenue with $1,264.48; **East** underperformed at $189.92  
- **B2C customers** drove ~63% of total revenue

ðŸŸ¢ **Strategic Implication:** Peak daily sales can inform promo timing; regional expansion is needed in underperforming areas like the East.

---

### ðŸŸ¦ Customer Insights & Segmentation
- **High spenders (33%)** generated the majority of revenue  
- **Medium (40%) and low spenders (27%)** offer room for growth via loyalty incentives and promotions  
- **South region** had the largest customer base (36%); **East** had the fewest customers and no B2B accounts

ðŸŸ¢ **Opportunity:** Grow share in low-volume regions and convert medium spenders through loyalty programs or bundled deals.

---

### ðŸŸª Product & Category Performance
- **Eyeshadow (19%)** and **Lipstick (14%)** were the top revenue drivers  
- **Fenty Beauty** dominated the Lip category, accounting for 25% of product revenue  
- High-revenue products like Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Palette showed **low volume, high value** outlier behavior

ðŸŸ¢ **Actionable Takeaway:** Prioritize top performers for seasonal promotions and bundling; reevaluate underperformers like Glossy Lip Balm or Hydrating Primer.

---

### ðŸŸª Pricing Strategy: Prestige vs. Drugstore Brands
- **Prestige brands** average price: **$28.64**  
- **Drugstore brands** average price: **$13.27**  
- **Urban Decay** was the highest-priced brand ($49.99 avg), nearly 4x higher than CoverGirl ($9.82)

ðŸŸ¢ **Insight:** Pricing tiers reveal distinct consumer targets. Consider dynamic pricing and promotional strategies to bridge or amplify this gap depending on audience.

---

### ðŸŸ¦ B2B vs. B2C Channel Analysis
- **B2C:** $1,776 in revenue from 70 units  
- **B2B:** $808.6 from 42 units  
- Top B2B buyers included **Target, Sephora, Walmart, Ulta, and Nordstrom**

ðŸŸ¢ **Growth Potential:** Expand B2B relationships and increase order frequency with repeat buyers.

---

### ðŸŸª Supplier & Inventory Optimization
- **Beauty World** led with 18 products supplied across just two orders  
- **46% of inventory** came from only three suppliersâ€”creating dependency risk  
- **Top-stocked products**: Colossal Mascara, Pro Glow Foundation, TruNaked Eyeshadow  
- **Low-stock alerts**: Naked Highlighter, Peach Blush, and select Fenty SKUs

ðŸŸ¡ **Strategic Risk:** Inventory and fulfillment depend on a few suppliersâ€”consider diversification and safety stock thresholds.

---

## ðŸŸ© Key Business Recommendations

1. **Double down on high-performing SKUs**: Allocate promo budgets to Eyeshadow and Lipstick products.
2. **Upsell medium spenders** through loyalty programs and personalized offers.
3. **Expand East region presence** with targeted acquisition and B2B outreach.
4. **Mitigate supply chain risk** by diversifying vendors beyond Beauty World and Cosmetic Hub.
5. **Leverage pricing tiers** to segment campaigns by buyer type (e.g., prestige lovers vs. drugstore loyalists).

## ðŸŸ¦ Report Features & Design Approach

This dashboard follows a multi-panel structure designed for business-ready insight delivery. In addition to analytical pages, it includes:

- An **Overview Page** to orient users to the purpose and layout  
- A **Navigation Page** for intuitive tab access  
- A **Story Page** to surface narrative themes  
- An **Insights & Recommendations** summary  
- A **Conclusions & Strategies for Growth** section to support executive decision-making  

This layout reflects real-world reporting workflows, making the report presentation-ready while improving user navigation.

---

### ðŸŸ¦ Iterative BI Report Development

This Power BI report was built using an **iterative design mindset**, treating each release as a versioned intelligence product. Differences between projects (e.g., presence of a navigation page or story layout) are purposeful and often influenced by the platform used.  

For instance, Power BI supports text-narrative pages directly, while Tableau requires a creative workaround using text blocks on blank dashboards.

This approach allows future iterations to evolve with stakeholder feedback, platform capabilities, and use-case expansionâ€”ensuring that each report version reflects both immediate value and longer-term growth potential.
