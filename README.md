# Beauty & Cosmetics Sales Performance and Analytics Dashboard

## Description
This project showcases a comprehensive Power BI analysis of beauty and cosmetics sales performance across various dimensions, including customer behavior, supplier performance, and regional trends. The dataset used in this project is **simulated and fictitious**, crafted to reflect real-world brands, products, and categories for illustrative and educational purposes. A key component of this project was the creation and optimization of a dynamic data model within Power BI, leveraging relational database concepts such as primary and foreign keys to establish meaningful relationships between tables. The project highlights advanced data transformation, interactive visualizations, and actionable insights tailored to decision-making in the beauty industry.

## Tools and Skills Used
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations, dashboards, and managing data models through table relationships (e.g., many-to-one, cross-filtering).
- **SQL**: To create, manage, and query the dataset, including importing structured data into Power BI.
- **Excel**: Advanced Pivot Tables, SUMIF calculations, and manual data cleansing for ETL processes.
- **ETL Process**: Extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it (cleaning, organizing, and restructuring for analysis), and loading it into Power BI.
- **Data Analysis**: Understanding trends, identifying actionable insights, and conducting exploratory analysis.
- **Relational Data Concepts**: Designing and optimizing table relationships for seamless analysis.
- **Business Intelligence**: Presenting data-driven insights and recommendations tailored to the beauty industry.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Sales Analysis**: Insights into customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dashboards with slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities.
- **Regional Performance Insights**: Geographical analysis of sales distribution.
- **Product & Supplier Analysis**: Understanding brand performance, category-level trends, and supplier contributions.

## Disclaimer
The dataset used in this project is entirely **simulated and fictitious**. While the dataset is inspired by real-world brands, products, and categories, it was fabricated solely for the purpose of demonstrating data analysis and business intelligence skills. Any resemblance to actual sales data or business performance is purely coincidental.
