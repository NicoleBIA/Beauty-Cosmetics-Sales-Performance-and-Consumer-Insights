# Beauty & Cosmetics Sales Performance and Analytics Dashboard

## Description
This project showcases a comprehensive Power BI analysis of beauty and cosmetics sales performance across various dimensions, including customer behavior, supplier performance, and regional trends. A key component of this project was the **creation and optimization of a dynamic data model** within Power BI, leveraging relational database concepts such as primary and foreign keys to establish meaningful relationships between tables. The project highlights advanced data transformation, interactive visualizations, and actionable insights tailored to decision-making in the beauty industry.

## Tools and Skills Used
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations, dashboards, and managing data models through table relationships (e.g., many-to-one, cross-filtering).
- **SQL**: To create, manage, and query the dataset, including importing structured data into Power BI.
- **Excel**: Advanced Pivot Tables, SUMIF calculations, and manual data cleansing to prepare and transform data for analysis.
- **ETL Processes**: Extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it (cleaning, organizing, and restructuring for analysis), and loading it into Power BI.
- **Relational Data Concepts**: Designing and optimizing table relationships to build a dynamic data model for seamless analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Identifying trends, patterns, and actionable insights through detailed exploratory analysis.
- **Business Intelligence**: Presenting data-driven insights and recommendations to support strategic decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Sales Analysis**: Insights into customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dashboards with slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities.
- **Regional Performance Insights**: Geographical analysis of sales distribution.
- **Product & Supplier Analysis**: Understanding brand performance, category-level trends, and supplier contributions.
